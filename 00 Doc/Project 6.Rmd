#**Introduction**
This is our R Notebook, showing the steps we took to complete Project 6 for CS 329E. This notebook includes step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce our project. To obtain our data, we used data.world. 

#**R Configuration**
Below we display our sessionInfo().

```{r sessionInfo}
sessionInfo(package=NULL)
```

#**Data Description**
Found in data.world, a customer based data set that looks at orders and shipments from different markets around the world.

#**Cleaning Data**
Here's our ETL file to clean our data set.

```{r}
source("../01 Data/R_ETL.GlobalShipments.R")
```

#**Cleaned up Data Download**
Cleaned data can be downloaded from Data.world as a .csv file. Because the dataset is so large, we filtered to only show some rows.
