#**Introduction**
This is our R Notebook, showing the steps we took to complete Project 5 for CS 329E. This notebook includes step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce our project. To obtain our data, we used data.world. 

#**R Configuration**
Below we display our sessionInfo().

```{r sessionInfo}
sessionInfo(package=NULL)
```

#**Data Description**
All data were obtained through esapubs.org. The dataset, Pantheria, contains 100740 lines of biological data for extant and recently extinct mammalian species and was collect over a span of three years. All data came as one textfile, which we edited using Microsoft Excel.

#**Cleaning Data**
Here's our ETL file to clean our data set.

```{r}
source("../01 Data/R_ETL.GlobalShipments.R")
```

#**Cleaned up Data Download**
Cleaned data can be downloaded from Data.world as a .csv file. Because the dataset is so large, we filtered to only show some rows.

#**Shiny Visualization and Published Application**
**Description:** A static .png of the Shiny application, as well as a link to the live published version. Crosstab 1 sums up the shipping costs by segment and state. The data is filtered on Country = United States and dislays the IN of Two Highest Shipping Segments.</br> Crosstab 2 breaks down the sum of sales by ship mode and state. The color highlights KPI - Sales per person Low to High. Again, the data is filtered on Country = United States and IN for Two Least Used Shipping Mode. </br>Lastly, Crosstab 3 covers sum of sales by sub-category and country. KPI reflects the profit to sales ratio low to high. The data is filtered on IN for Five Highest Sub-Categories.</br>
